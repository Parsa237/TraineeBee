        is an Exchange Program between the Netherlands and England for four weeks in total.<br>
        They have been working on this project and had allot of fun with it.<br>
        <br>
        In the exchange the Dutch students showed the places where they went to for theire internship,<br>
        To showed them what it is like and how this will function in theire education<br>
        and What type of profits it has for the student and companies.
        (To know more about what the profits are about Internships in your <a href="#info" class="Links">company</a>.
        The students interviewed the companies as well and got exited about the amount they were missing. <br>
        <br>
        The students will also learn how they work in different countries, what their work progress is like and in big
        international groups which is a great move for all the students in the future.<br> The two groups showed them
        their city. From the begin it was very clear what we wanted. We wanted a site which make it possible to have
        internships in the UK as well
        and to Help Students College and Companies their way through this new way.
