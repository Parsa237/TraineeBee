            Who are we?
            We are a collection of 13 students from the Netherlands and Britain working on a project together to promote
            internships into the English education system.
            Why are we doing this?
            Our main goal is to promote internships, programs that while in education, students get a hands-on
            experience in the work place that allows them to work with a company for a long duration of time. They also
            allow companies to see upcoming prodigies, get to work with students who are motivated and possibly find a
            future employee.
