            they have been working on this project. And had allot of fun with it.<br>
            <br>
            In the exchange the Dutch people showed the places where they went to for theire internship.<br>
            To showed them what it is like and how this will function in theire education.<br>
            And What type of profits it has for the student and companies.
            (To know more about what the profits are about Internships in your <a href="/info" class="Links">company</a>.
            The students interviewed the companies as well and got exited about the amount they were missing. <br>
            <br>
            The students will also learn how they work in different countries, what their work progress is like. And in big international groups which is a great move for all the students in the future.<br> The two groups showed them their city. From the begin it was very clear what we wanted. We wanted a site which make it possible to have internships in the UK as well.
            And to Help Students College and Companies their way through this new way.
