                they have been working on this project. And had allot of fun with it.<br>
                <br>
                In the exchange the Dutch people showed the places where they went to for theire internship.<br>
                To showed them what it is like and how this will function in theire education.<br>
                And What type of profits it has for the student and companies.
                (To know more about what the profits are abour Internships in your company <a href="/Companies" class="Links">Click here</a>.)
                The students intervieuwd the companies ass well and  got exited about the amount they were missing. <br>
                <br>
                The students will also learn How they work in different countries, what thiere work progress is like. And in big international groups which is a great move for all the students in the future.<br> The Two Groups Showed Them Their City. From the Begin It was Very Clear what we wanted. We Wanted A Site which make it Possible to Have Internships in the UK as Well.
                And to Help Students College and Companies their way through this new way.
