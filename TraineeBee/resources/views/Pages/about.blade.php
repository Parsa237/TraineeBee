        <h1>About the Project</h1>
        <p>Trainee Bee </p><div class="smaller">Join the Hive TM</div> is an Exange Program between the Netherlands and England for four weeks in total.<br>
        they have been working on this project. And had allot of fun with it.<br>
        <br>
        In the exchange the Dutch people showed the places where they went to for theire internship.<br>
        To showed them what it is like and how this will function in theire education.<br>
        And What type of profits it has for the student and companies.
        (To know more about what the profits are about Internships in your <a href="/Companies" class="Links">company</a>.
        The students interviewed the companies as well and got exited about the amount they were missing. <br>
        <br>
        The students will also learn how they work in different countries, what their work progress is like. And in big international groups which is a great move for all the students in the future.<br> The two groups showed them their city. From the begin it was very clear what we wanted. We wanted a site which make it possible to have internships in the UK as well.
        And to Help Students College and Companies their way through this new way.
